///// React component ///////////////////
React component is a function that returns html. This combination between JavaScript and 
html is called JSX such as <App />. React application only renders one component <App />. So, 
we should put our custom components inside the <App /> components or other components. 

React is nice because we can build reusable components and use them in various projects.
This is fantastic! So let's build a simple Food component and pass props to it. 

In practice, data come in the form of an array from a server and components
 need to be created automatically not manually. We can use javascript map method 
 to create components magically!

 React expects a unique key for each component. So, let's define a key for each food component. 

 One important point that must be taken into account is that typechecking is so important for React components. This is
 true because sometimes we use components with wrong props and it fails to work properly without throwing an error on 
 Js console. To alleviate this proplem, there is a package called prop-types. In this commit we show how to use it with Reac
 components. 
 $ npm i prop-types
